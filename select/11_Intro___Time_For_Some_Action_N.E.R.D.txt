"Y'know, when I was a kid growing up
We used to love playing outside, riding bikes
And that was the 80's, record heatwaves
I mean people were like
Dying on the side of the road
Getting heatstrokes
So the only thing you could do
Was go in the house and, y'know
Take a shower a couple of times a day
So, I'll never forget I was
Like seven years old
I closed my eyes, and that's when it started
I started seeing sounds, whoa!"
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
Eh yes, yes, right there
I like it, 'scuse me! Hey
Yeah, you know the scenario
Images circle your mind like a merry-go
If you just tunin into your stereo
Turn this bitch up, here we go
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
I'm more like a vulture, far from a dove
Don't you mistake this, ma, this is not love
It's lust no cuddles and hugs
This is for floor and rugs
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
Yo, the sweat on your body
It creates a scent
No liquor, no pills, only that gets me bent
I'm loving your clothes
Especially the prints get it, the prints?
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
Hey, you ain't know I was a nasty guy?
You say you wanna flash me, right?
You know only I could smash you, right?
Well alright
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
It's time for some action
What can you imagine?
It's time for some action
What can you imagine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action)
I see what's going on
I've been sitting there all along
Just waiting and waiting 'cause I'm tired
(Time for some action, time for some action)
I ain't got nothing to say, nothing to do
But I've been waiting for so long
And I think, I think, I think I'm through
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action
