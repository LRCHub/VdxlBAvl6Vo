Time 4 some action Yeah u know the scenario
Images circle ur mind like a merry go
If u just tune that into ur stereo
Turn this bitch up here we go

Time 4 some action I'm more like a vulture
Far from a dove
Don't u mistake this ma this is not love
It's lust
No cuddles and hugs
This is for floor and rugs

Time 4 some action Yo the sweat on ur body
It creates a sink
No liquor no pills only that's gets me bent
I'm loving your clothes especially the prints
Get it, the prints

Time 4 some action Hey, you aint know I was a nasty guy
U say u wanna flash me right
U know only I could smash u right
Well alright

Time 4 some action It's time 4 some action
What can u imagine
Its time 4 some action
What can u imagine

Whoa Time 4 some action
